# Furball

Furball is a lightweight framework for creating RESTful APIs using .Net.  It is built to run inside OWIN, using as few external dependencies as possible.  Furball uses a combination of attributes, convention and configuration to determine the routes available and what methods are used for the routes.
 
This is still in the early alpha stages, so things will be changing quickly as things are refined and improved.  The milestones will give an indication of what features will be released.  The Roadmap in the wiki will give a clearer indication of what changes will come in the future.
